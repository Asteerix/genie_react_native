# Wishlist Feature Analysis

## Key Findings

1. **API URL Structure Corrected**
   - The `api.ts` file has been fixed to use `API_URL = ${API_BASE_URL}` instead of `${API_BASE_URL}/api`
   - This prevents the double `/api/api` path issue that was causing 404 errors

2. **Backend API Structure**
   - The backend correctly implements the wishlist functionality with routes under `/api/wishlists`
   - These routes are properly authenticated using middleware

3. **Frontend Components**
   - All necessary components for wishlist management are properly implemented:
     - `WishlistScreen.tsx` - Shows lists of wishlists and wish items
     - `WishlistSettingsScreen.tsx` - Allows changing wishlist settings
     - `WishlistOptionalInfoModal.tsx` - For adding descriptions and admins
     - `AddAdminModal.tsx` - For selecting friends as admins

4. **Context & API Integration**
   - `WishlistContext.tsx` provides state management and API integration
   - API endpoints in `wishlists.ts` are correctly defined
   - Authentication and token refresh logic is properly implemented

5. **Missing Functionality**
   - The `wishlist_handler.go` backend implementation is complete
   - The frontend components and context are properly connected

## Recommendations

1. **Testing**
   - Test creating, editing, and deleting wishlists through the UI
   - Verify that proper error handling is shown in the UI when network issues occur

2. **Enhancements**
   - Add loading indicators during API calls to improve user experience
   - Implement optimistic updates for faster UI response
   - Consider adding offline support for viewing wishlists

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the wishlist API endpoints for future reference
   - Add comments to explain complex state management code

The wishlist feature should now be fully functional, with proper API integration and user interface components.
